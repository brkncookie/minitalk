Client Logic:
	-simply loop through the string and decode every character into binary to send it with either SIGUSR1/SIGUSR2 to the server.
	-the decoding will be done using the & bitwise operator testing every bit in the character.
	-after that is done implement a singal handler that recieves the messages acknowledgement from the server.
Server  Logic:
	-implement a signal handler that decode the binary data into a character.
	-loop on a puase() call while waiting for the whole string to be recieved.
